                        To the left is a visualisation of the percentage energy access of countries in the year 2019. The large majority of countries around the world are able to provide
                        energy access to almost 100% of their residents. Some notable regions with low energy access percentages include the Africa and Asia regions. Specifically, 
                        <b>South Sudan</b>, <b>Chad</b> and the <b>Central African Republic</b> have energy access percentages of <b>6.7%</b>, <b>8.4%</b> and <b>14.3%</b> respectively.

                        Providing "access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" is the 7th sustainable developement goal set out by the United Nations.
                        While almost 90% of the world's population have access to electricity, providing adaquate service and infrastructure to those in predominately rural
                        locations will prove to be a challenge heading into the future. Below are the timeseries for countries with notability low access percentages.

                        The visualisation to the left depicts the annual energy consumption per capita categorised by country. The total energy consumption per capita is 
                        measured by a logarthmic scale using units of kWh.

                        The total energy consumption per capita of a specific year can further be adjusted using the slider on the bottom. Below is a timeseries of the

                Below is a visualisation of the increase in global energy consumption by primary energy source type. From the beginning of the data in 1800, traditional biomass
                (e.g. wood, charcoal and leaves) was the main source of energy and continues to be a significant portion of the energy mix in developing countries. Today, a large
                percentage of energy consumed is derived from coal, gas and oil, while newer emerging technologies such as nuclear power, hydropower, solar power and biofuels
                occupy a small proportion of the mix.

            <h2>What type of renewable energy sources are being used?</h2>
            <p class = "body_text">
                The consumption of energy derived from sources that include coal, gas and oil and the associated emmission of greenhouse gases is a key factor in the global
                climate change issue. The need to "take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts" is the 13th sustainable development goal set out by the 
                United Nations (UN). According to the UN, 2019 was the secondest warmest year ever recorded and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached an all
                time high. Note the substantially lower TWh consumptions compared to the left.

                Below are the top 20 countries by the renewable proportion of their energy mix. While countries such as Iceland and Norway exhibit outstanding renewable
                power generation with proportions greater than 50%, the large majority of nations are currently producing less than 10% from renewable sources. The widespread
                adoption of renewable energy is pivotal in minimising the effects of climate change and creating a sustainable Earth.

                The following scatterplot indicates that there is a general correlation between the annual energy consumption per person
                and the GDP per capita of a country. The GDP per capita of each country has been standardised using the international dollar. For a given country,
                one international dollar would purchase an equivalent amount of goods and services that one U.S dollar could obtain in the United States of America.
                The countries have further been categorised based on their continent. The legend on the right can be used as a filter to view a specific continent.
